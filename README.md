# Task Manager - Node Express Rest API (ES6)

Rest API project scaffold, built using:

- Node.js version 10.15 LTS.

- ES6. No transpilation (No babel) as this version of node supports majority of ES6 language features.

- Express.

- Sequelize ORM (MySQL dialect).

- bcrypt (for password hashing & comparison).

- jsonwebtoken and express-jwt for token creation and validations.

- joi for validations.

- APIs returning responses in uniform formats, wraps exceptions/ errors in formatted response.

- Properly layered architecture (routes -> controllers -> services -> sequelize models).

- Written using vscode, hence built-in capability for debugging from within vscode editor.

- No complex configurations. Configuration is managed using environment vars through dotenv (.env).
